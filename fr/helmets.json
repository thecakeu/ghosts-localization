While it filters some toxins and radioactive particles from the air that is breathed in, it is not nearly as effective as proper protective equipment as it leaves the the eyes and face exposed to the elements.\n\nIt offers zero physical protection.\n\nStill, better than nothing. There are no choosing beggars in the Zone.",
